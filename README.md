# Teacher-Management-System
In this Project ,I made GUI which contains all the given components. I made 
TeacherGUI class which holds lecturer and tutor objects. Then I made text fields for the 
GUI. I also implemented add lecturer button in which when the button is pressed the input 
values of the given components is added to an array list of Teacher class. I made a add 
Tutor button where the input values are used to create a new object of the type Tutor 
which is added to the array list of Teacher class. I also made the button for grade 
assignments in which the input value of teacher id is compared to the existing teacher id 
and if valid teacher id is given it is used to generate the grade assignments from lecturer 
class. The set salary of Tutor button set the salary of Tutor when valid teacher id has 
been entered. Then I made the remove Tutor button to remove tutor when the valid 
teacher id is entered. Also I made the display button to display the information in a 
appropriate way and at last a clear button to clear all the values from the text fields.
